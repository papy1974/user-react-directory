The project is named User-react-directory.

objective

The purpose of the User-react-directory is that we want to be able to view the entire employee directory at once so that we have have quick access to their information.An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name. in the exercice we use Hooks to converted all Class components to Function components, useContext instead pass props, and useEffet.
